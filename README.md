## Purpose
This project was created as a demonstration of the 2D capabilities that Unity has to offer. It is meant to reflect on
the readings assigned based on the book, **_Unity in Action: Multiplatform Game Development in C#_** by _Joseph Hocking_.

This project was shown to IMM 360: Games 1 as a part of the IMM 391 (Games 1 Learning Assistant) curriculum.

## Project Description
This project is a playable Tic-Tac-Toe meant to be done by two users. 

The following information reflects the thought process to conduct such game and can serve as a helpful step-by-step guideline:
* Create the grid using sprites
* Create objects for the X and O using sprites
* Implement placement based on mouse click (pieces should only be placed in valid locations)
* Set up turns so that after one click, the other sprite becomes active
* Prevent playing on an already-played spot
* Determine a winner or stalemate and present the result to the players.

## Applications Used
* Unity for development
* Adobe Photoshop for Sprite Creation
